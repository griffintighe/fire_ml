# fire_ml
a project for forecasting and predicting calls to fire stations in sf  
the data used for this project comes from here https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Map-of-Fire-Incidents/x93u-2mr2

NOTE I have no relation  or  affiliation to the local government in sf or the fire deparments 

-----------
Currently this project is in very early stages 
ALSO I would recomend using tableau to explore the spatial part of this data
